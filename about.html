			<h3>Who We Are</h3>
			Masters In Technology is a student-led Extra Curricular Activity (ECA) started by Antonio Song in 2012. We are a group of students from Years 10 to 13 who are proficient in the use of computers and software.

			<h3>What We Do</h3>
			<h4>Student Workshops</h4>
			MIT organizes and leads workshops for other students in the school. We host email etiquette and Office 365 workshops for KS3 students and teach IB students how to use applications that are needed for the IB such as Logger Pro and Microsoft Office Excel.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Parent Workshops</h4>
			Every year, MIT hosts parent workshops. We send out a survey to determine which topics parents are interested in learning. The workshops last around an hour. Topics we have taught in the past include Mac 101, Photoshop, iMovie, and more. See <a href="/events.html">our events page</a> to see what events are coming soon.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>On-Demand Teacher Assistance</h4>
			Teachers at DCB can make appointments on our Office 365 Calendar and request one-on-one training regarding a topic of their choice. MIT then arranges for a specialist to meet the teacher at a time and place of the teacher's choosing.
