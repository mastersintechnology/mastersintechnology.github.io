<h2>Transpose-Paste in Microsoft Excel</h2>
<p>
	Have you ever created a row of values in Excel only to realize you needed them to be in a column? Excel has a transpose-paste function.<br><br>
	First, select the cells containing the values you want to put in a colunm and copy them.<br>
	<img src="/techtips/2017/transpose1.jpg" alt="Copying values"><br>
	Select a cell into which the values should be pasted. Note that you cannot select a cell that is already occupied by the values you are copying. Use 'Paste Special' (Control+Command+V or right-click then 'Paste Special')<br>
	<img src="/techtips/2017/transpose2.jpg" alt="Paste Special"><br>
	At the bottom of the window that appears, tick 'Transpose' to enable the transpose function (see below to understand what 'transpose' really means).<br>

	Click OK and the values should now be pasted after being transposed. If you selected a single row, they should now be in a single column. See this GIF to understand how transpose works:<br>

	Note that this special paste function can be applied to any number of cells, not just a single row or column. When pasted, those cells will be transformed as shown in the animation above.
