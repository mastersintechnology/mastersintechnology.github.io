<h2>Searching for Text in Documents and Webpages</h2>
<p>
	Have you ever skimmed through a webpage looking for something because there wasn't an index or table of contents? Press Command+F (Control+F on Windows) in practically any browser to quickly search the entire page. You can also search PDFs, Word/Pages documents, and more. Note that not all applications may support this feature.<br><br>
