<h2>Taking Screenshots</h2>
<p>
	Taking a picture of something in the real world to show it to someone else is easy, but what if you want to show someone something on your computer screen? Instead of taking a picture of it with your phone, which reduces the quality, take a screenshot.<br>
	<h3>Mac</h3>
	The default shortcuts on Mac are Shift+Command+3 to take a picture of the whole screen and Shift+Command+4 to take a picture of a part of the screen. When taking a screenshot of a part of the screen, a crosshair in place of the cursor will appear to indicate the upper left corner of the area to screenshot. Click and drag to indicate the area you want to screenshot. By default, screenshots appear on your Desktop.<br><br>
	To change the shortcuts for screenshots, open System Preferences and go to Keyboard > Shortcuts > Screen Shots.
	<h3>Windows</h3>
	On Windows, you can use the Snipping Tool application to take screenshots. Look for 'Snipping Tool' in the Start menu (or use the search function). Note that this program may not be available on older systems. Click the 'New' button to take a screenshot. The image will appear in its own window and you can choose to save it.
