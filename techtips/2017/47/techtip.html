<h2>File Sharing on Mac</h2>
<p>
	AirDrop was introduced in Mac OS X Lion (10.7) (learn how to identify your OS <a href="/learn/mac101/identifyOS/identifyOS.html">here</a>). It allows Macs to share files wirelessly with other Macs on the same local WiFi network. You can access it by pressing Shift+Command+R while the Finder has focus or by clicking the Go menu > AirDrop. AirDrop appears in the sidebar unless you remove it. You can check if your Mac supports AirDrop <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203106">here</a>.<br>
	This is what the AirDrop window looks like in Sierra:<br>

	In Mountain Lion (10.8), the Share button was introduced. You can share files without having to open the application or service with which you want to share the file. For example, you can click the Share button and then 'AirDrop' to share via AirDrop without opening AirDrop. In these images, contact names have been covered.<br>

	You can also access sharing options by right clicking on the file you want to share.<br>
