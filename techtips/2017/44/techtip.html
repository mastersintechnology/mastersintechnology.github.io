<h2>Different Headers and Footers in Microsoft Word</h2>
<p>
	Many books have two separate page numbering systems. The table of contents has i, ii, iii, and so on whereas the pages with the actual content are numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on. You can do this in Word by creating separate sections.<br><br>
	Once you reach the end of the first section, go to Layout > Breaks and click a break in the 'Section Breaks' section.<br>

	Then, while editing the header/footer of the next section, disable 'Link to Previous'.<br>

	Now you can set the header and footer to be different from the ones on other pages. In this example, a different page numbering system is used. Note the selection of 'Start at' instead of 'Continue from previous section'.<br>
