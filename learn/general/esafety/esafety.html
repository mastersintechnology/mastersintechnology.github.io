		<h2><u>Top 5 E-safety tips</u></h2>
		<p>
			The Internet is an amazingly useful tool (for research, communication or entertainment), but it does have its dangers. Be aware of some ways to keep you safe, so you’re not sorry when you surf the web.

		<ol type="1">
			<li><b>Keep it private</b> – don’t post any personal information online (like your address, email, phone number…anything you wouldn’t want a stranger to know.) Again, if you’ve got an old account you don’t use anymore, close it down; no good will come out of leaving personal information online unnecessarily.
			<li><b>Think twice</b> – whenever you want to post a picture or a video online, think about whether you’d be comfortable with someone you respect (like a teacher or a parent) seeing it. If that feels embarrassing or uncomfortable, don’t do it.
			<li><b>Check your settings</b> – keep your privacy settings on social media as high as possible. Get anti-virus software to keep your computer secure too.
			<li><b>Seal your lips (and your fingers!)</b> – passwords are the keys to your private accounts online. They should never be given out; just like how you’d never hand your keys over to a complete stranger.
			<li><b>Don’t “friend” strangers</b> – we know it’s tempting to click “accept” when you get that friend request from Barry in England. But unless you actually know him in real life, don’t befriend him; not everyone online is who they say they are.
