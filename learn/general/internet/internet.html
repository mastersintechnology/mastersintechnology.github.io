			It is important to understand the difference between web browsers and search engines. When you want to find information on the internet, you have to use both of these tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Web Browsers</h2>
			A web browser is an application that allows people to access information via the internet. This information can be browsed in the form of text, image, video, audio, etc on a web page. The most prominent web browsers include Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and Firefox. Internet Explorer is also a web browser, but it is generally considered worse than its alternatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>How Does a Web Browser Work?</h2>
			When you want to view a web page, you need to know the web address (or Uniform Resource Locator, or URL). The address you used to visit our website (mit.dulwich-beijing.cn) is a URL. When you type the address in the address bar and press Enter (or click on a suggested link) the web browser asks for the webpage at the specified address and displays it for you to see.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Search Engines</h2>
			A search engine is a software program that searches for information on the internet, based on the words that the user types in as input. This program goes through its databases of information to retrieve the information the user is looking for. The most prominent search engines include Google, Yahoo, and Bing.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Using Search Engines</h2>
			You don't have to understand all the behind-the-scenes technology for search engines to use them properly. Here are some tips for searching more efficiently:
			<ul>
				<li>Search engines are case-insensitive. Searching 'MIT' and 'mit' will give the same results. Save time by not pressing shift all the time.
				<li>On some search engines, such as Google, use quotation marks ("") to search for a specific phrase. Normally, search engines just search for each word in the query separately. This can narrow down search results.
				<li>On Google, use the words AND and OR to search for pages that match multiple or different criteria (such as 'apples AND oranges' to find both, or 'apples OR oranges' to search for either fruit).
				<li>On Google, use the plus sign to search for special words: 'peanut butter and jelly' searches for pages that match both 'peanut butter' and 'jelly' whereas 'peanut butter +and jelly' searches for that specific phrase.
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Main Differences Between a Web Browser and a Search Engine</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Browsers merely allow you to easily access data on the internet. Search engines let you search for things, whereas browsers require the address to find information.
				<li>The standard way of interacting with a search engine is to visit the webpage (e.g. cn.bing.com or www.google.com) and enter your query.
				<li>Browsers require installation but search engines do not because they are not stored locally.
			</ul>
			When you want to find out about something, you open a web browser and access a search engine page and enter a query. The search engine is what is giving you the information, but the browser is what allows you to access that information.
