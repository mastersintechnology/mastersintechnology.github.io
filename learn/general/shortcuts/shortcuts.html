        <h1>Using Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>

			<h2>What is a keyboard shortcut?</h2>
			Keyboard shortcuts are shortcuts to actions in applications. Some applications may be configured to respond to keystrokes in a particular way, but <i>in general</i>, a keyboard shortcut consists of one or more <b>modifier keys</b> and <u>one</u> normal key.<br>
			Modifier keys and their symbols:
			<ul>
				<li>Control (⌃)
				<li>Alt (also called Option on Mac) (⌥)
				<li>Function (fn)
				<li>Shift (⇧)
				<li>Mac only: Command (⌘)
				<li>Windows only: Windows key (no symbol)
			</ul>
			When running Windows on a Mac (for example with Bootcamp), the Command key is treated as if it were the Windows key.

			<h2>Where are the modifier keys?</h2>
			This image of a virtual keyboard shows the location of the modifiers on a Mac keyboard. The layout of the keys may vary depending on the country of origin of your Mac, but the modifiers keys will always be in the same place. The locations of modifier keys on Windows machines may vary, but Control, the Function key, and Alt should appear in more or less the same position. The Windows key is where the Command key is. Some machines may have two Control keys instead of two Windows keys.<br>

			<h2>How do I use keyboard shortcuts?</h2>
			To use a keyboard shortcut, press and hold the required modifier keys and then press the required non-modifier key. The modifier keys have to be held while the non-modifier key is pressed; simply tapping the modifier keys and then another key will not be enough.<br><br>
			For example, the shortcut for copying is ⌘C (⌃C on Windows). Select the text you want to copy, then hold the Command/Control key and press C. This copies the selected text to the clipboard. To paste the text, use ⌘V (⌃V on Windows).
