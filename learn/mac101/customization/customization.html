			<a name="BG+Scrsave"><h2>Setting a Desktop Background and Screen Saver</h2></a>
			Every release of Mac comes with its own default background, but you can also set your own in System Preferences. The quickest way to launch System Preferences is via the Apple menu.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/prefs1.jpg"><br><br>
			Click on 'Desktop &amp; Screen Saver' to set your desktop background and screen screen saver.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/bg1.jpg"><br><br>
			You can pick from Apple's backgrounds or you can choose your own. Click the '+' button to add a folder containing your desired desktop background and click the desired image on the right to set the background. You can also make the background change automatically ever once in a while. If this is enabled, you can randomize the order. When 'Change Picture' is enabled, all pictures in the folder will be used. If you only want to cycle through some pictures, they have to be in their own folder.<br>

			The screen saver appears automatically if you leave the computer idle for a long time. You can specify how long the computer should wait before activating the screen saver.<br>
			You can pick from various built-in screen savers, some of which use your choice of images. Various customization options are available.<br>

			<a name="Dock"><h2>Dock</h2></a>
			The Dock is the bar from which you can launch applications and access minimized windows and folders of your choosing. With factory settings, the Dock appears on the bottom of the screen, but it can be moved to any side except the top of the screen. By default, the Downloads folder appears on the Dock.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/dock3.png" alt="Dock on the bottom of the screen" width="500" height="120"><br><br>
			To customize the Dock, open System Preferences and Click 'Dock.'<br>

			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/dock2.jpg" width="680" height="390"><br><br>
			You can also drag folders to the Dock for easy access. They can only be placed on the side of the Dock with the trash icon; only applications can be dragged to the other side of the Dock.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/dock4.png"><br><br>
			Right click the folder icon to customize display options.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/dock5.png"><br><br>
			To remove a folder or application from the Dock, drag it off the Dock and hold until the 'Remove' label appears. On older systems, a small puff of smoke appears next to the icon instead. You may have to drag the icon far away from the Dock before the smoke or icon appears.<br>

			<a name="Launchpad"><h2>Launchpad</h2></a>
			In Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and later (identify your OS <a href="/learn/mac101/identifyOS/identifyOS.html">here</a>), the Launchpad gives you a view with all your applications. It strongly resembles the Home screen on iOS and works more of less in the same way.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/lpad1.png" width="800"><br><br>
			Scroll sideways (this might not be supported by your mouse; to scroll sideways on a trackpad, simply move two fingers sideways instead of vertically) or use the arrow keys to move between pages.<br><br>
			Drag an application on top of another to create a folder. Note that if the icon is dragged too far to either side instead of directly on top of another, Launchpad will simply reorder them instead of creating a folder. Drag other applications into those folders to sort your applications. Folders can be renamed. Open the folder and click the name to rename it.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/lpad2.jpg" width="800"><br><br>
			Click and hold an application icon or hold the Option key (find out more about modifier keys <a href="/learn/general/shortcuts/shortcuts.html">here</a>) to enable editing mode on Launchpad. The icons will start to shake, like on iOS. Apps downloaded from the App Store will have an X button you can click to delete them. Built-in apps and apps downloaded from other sources cannot be deleted this way.<br>
			<img src="/learn/mac101/customization/lpad3.jpg" width="640" height="280"><br><br>
			In Mountain Lion (10.8) and later, you can also search for applications in Launchpad. Start typing to search for applications. You can also search for the initials of the applications instead of their full names, such as 'mw' for Microsoft Word.<br>
