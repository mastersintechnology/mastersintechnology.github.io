			Computers are very powerful and can do many things at the same time. Humans can't do two things simultaneously as efficiently as computers, but there are many ways to do quickly switch between two tasks on a Mac that are faster than simply moving windows around so you can click on the one you want.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Dock</h2>
			A quick and simple way to switch to another application is to click on its icon in the Dock. The Dock is the bar that can be on the left, right, or bottom of the screen and contains the icons for all open applications and any applications put there for easy access.<br><br>
			For more details on the Dock, see <a href="/learn/mac101/customization/customization.php#dock">Customizing Your Mac § Dock</a>
		</p>

			<h2>Application Switcher</h2>
			To quickly switch between applications, use the ⌘Tab shortcut (find out more about keyboard shortcuts <a href="/learn/general/shortcuts/shortcuts.php">here</a>). This will show the application switcher, in which all your open applications are shown in order of latest access; the leftmost app is the current app, the second is the one you used before the current one, and the rightmost app is the one you haven't used in the most time.<br>

			The application switcher will remain onscreen until the Command key is released. At this point, the highlighted application will take focus (i.e. you will be switched to that application). There are three ways to select the application you wish to use.
			<ol>
				<li><b>Using the Tab key and the backtick key</b>: As long as the switcher is visible, pressing the Tab key will select the next application in the switcher. Pressing the backtick key (located above the Tab key on QWERTY keyboards and contains these symbols: `, ~) will select the previous application in the switcher.
				<li><b>Using the arrow keys</b>: As long as the switcher is visible, pressing the left and right arrow keys (usually at the bottom right corner of the keyboard) will select the previous and next application in the switcher, respectively.
				<li><b>Using the mouse/trackpad</b>: As long as the switcher is visible, you can use the cursor to select an application by moving the cursor over the application icon.
			</ol>
			After you have selected the application you wish to use, release the Command key. This will dismiss the application switcher and focus will be given to the highlighted application.<br>
			Note that after you switch to a different application, the ordering of applications in the switcher will be different because the order in which you last used them will have changed.
		</p>

			<h2>Mission Control</h2>
			<b>Note:</b>Mission Control is only available on versions of Mac newer than Lion (10.7). If you do not know what version of Mac you are running, visit <a href="/learn/mac101/identifyOS/identifyOS.php">Identifying Your Operating System</a>.<br><br>
			Mission Control is a feature that allows you to separate your open applications into different desktops and view all the open windows in the current desktop. This is especially useful if you tend to have many windows and applications open at the same time.<br>
			By default, pressing F3 on your keyboard (located above the 3 key; has three boxes on it) or swiping up on a trackpad with four fingers launches Mission Control. You can see a demonstration of this trackpad gesture by opening System Preferences, clicking on Trackpad, going to More Gestures, then placing the cursor over the words Mission Control in the list of gestures.<br><br>
			This gives you a "bird's eye view" of your work, as shown below:<br>
