			Parental controls allows you to limit the kinds of actions and content that can be accessed by certain users on a computer. This can be useful for preventing young users from accessing explicit content or limiting computer usage time. Note that parental controls cannot be enabled for <a href="/learn/general/accounts/accounts.php">administrator accounts</a>. You must have a separate administrator account and make the accounts for which parental controls will be enabled a normal user. Please be aware of the consequences of enabling parental controls for a user:
			<h4>If that user does not know the administrator password</h4>
			Installing software requires permission from an administrator. Being unable to install new software can potentially disrupt school work. For example, if parental controls is enabled on a student's laptop and s/he doesn't know the admin password but has to install some third-party software for an assignment, s/he will be unable to complete that assignment before returning home and asking someone to enter the admin password.
			<h4>If that user knows the administrator password</h4>
			Parental Controls settings can be circumvented using the administrator password. For example, if a managed user tries to open an app that has been disabled through Parental Controls, entering the administrator password will allow them to open that app. Other settings can also be circumvented by entering the password. Giving the administrator password to a managed user effectively voids all parental controls.

			You may have to relock the preference pane by clicking the lock. Note that the preference pane will be automatically locked after you quit System Preference. Exiting the preference pane (e.g. by clicking 'Show All') will <b>not</b> lock the pane.<br>
