        <h1>Using Spotlight on Mac</h1>
		<a href="/learn.html">Back to all topics</a>
		<p>
            
			Spotlight is a search feature that is built into the Mac operating system. It lets you search for files, applications, and more. To access Spotlight, use the keyboard shortcut (find out more about keyboard shortcuts <a href="/learn/general/shortcuts/shortcuts.html">here</a>) or click on the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar. The default shortcut is âŒ˜Space.<br>
			Note that Notification Center (the three lines next to the magnifying glass) is not available on versions of Mac older than Mountain Lion (learn how to check your version <a href="/learn/mac101/identifyOS/identifyOS.html">here</a>) and will therefore not appear in the menu bar.<br>

			Spotlight also gets dictionary entries and performs mathematical calculations. It recognizes the words 'pi' and 'e' as mathematical constants. Note that trignonometric functions take input in radians. To find the square root of a number, type 'sqrt(number)'.<br>

			You can customize which items should be search for in System Preferences. Reducing the number of searchable categories can increase search speed.<br>

			Spotlight is very useful, but sometimes it covers important content on the screen. In OS X El Capitan (10.11) and newer, you can move the Spotlight search window by dragging the search results window. To reset the position of the Spotlight window, click and hold the Spotlight icon in the menu bar until the search window moves back to the center.<br>
