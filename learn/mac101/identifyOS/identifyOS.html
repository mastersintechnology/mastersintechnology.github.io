			A lot of what we do today is done online through web apps and services. However, different versions of the same operating system (OS) can have different features; standalone apps (the ones you download and use offline) can have different system requirements. Certain versions of applications may not support your operating system. Therefore, you should know how to identify the OS you are running.

			To determine what version of Mac you are running, click on the Apple menu and click on "About this Mac".<br>

			A window will appear with the name and version number of your operating system. The image below is what would be shown on a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra (version 10.12) (the serial number has been covered for privacy reasons).

			Below is the same window in Mac OS X El Capitan (version 10.11).<br>

			The 'About this Mac' window on older systems, such as Mountain Lion, looks like this:<br>

			Mac operating systems likely to be in use today:
			<ul>
				<li>macOS Sierra - 10.12
				<li>Mac OS X El Capitan - 10.11
				<li>Mac OS X Yosemite - 10.10
				<li>Mac OS X Mavericks - 10.9
				<li>Mac OS X Mountain Lion - 10.8
				<li>Mac OS X Lion - 10.7
				<li>Mac OS X Snow Leopard - 10.6
			</ul>
			<b>Note:</b> the change in branding of the operating system ("macOS" instead of "Mac OS X") is a decision made by Apple Inc. after the release of Sierra.<br>
			Lion, Mountain Lion, Yosemite, and El Capitan are most notable in terms of new features introduced. Some features described in other Mac 101 pages may not be available in all operating systems. Any features unavailable before a certain version of Mac will be indicated.<br>
