        <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
        <p>
        	To plagiarize something is to to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own or to use (another's production) without crediting the source.  If I simply state that definition, I would be plagiarizing, as this definition is not my own; it belongs to the Merriam-Webster dictionary company.  By not stating the source of a piece of intellectual property, I am implying that I own something or have permission to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Plagiarism is primarily a concern of academic honesty where it is usually in the form of the theft of ideas.  Whenever any statement about anything is made, if it is not an original thought, its source must be cited, or else the author of that statement has claimed ownership of that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
        	There is a common misconception that only direct quotes from texts must be cited, but plagiarism encompasses all forms of intellectual property.  One owns all original ideas that they have, and  if another claims that it that idea is theirs either directly or via not citing a source, they are plagiarizing.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of Plagiarism</h3>
        <p>
        	<ul>
				<li>Copy-pasting a paragraph from Wikipedia to use in an essay
				<li>Taking the general idea from a paper and including it in yours without citing it
				<li>Having someone else do major edits on your work and not crediting them as an author
				<li>Taking something you "heard once" and using as if it were yours
				<li>Using a picture you found on Google Images in a presentation without permission
				<li>Hiring someone to write an essay for you
				<li>Letting someone copy your homework
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        	The only exception when citing ideas is when an idea is common knowledge.  MIT defines common knowledge as "information that the average, educated reader would accept as reliable without having to look it up".  What this knowledge is changes depends on the audience, but it includes information that most people in the target audience's academic discipline or country know. (MIT)
        </p>
        <h2>Citations</h2>
        <p>
        	The "MIT" in parentheses in the paragraph above is what is known as an inline citation.  A citation is "an act of quoting" (Merriam-Webster), and it shows that a certain peice of information does not belong to you.
        </p>
        <p>
        	There are many different ways to cite information.  Some popular styles include MLA and APA.  They differ in whether they use parentheses or footnotes to define a citation, and they also differ in their bibliography styles.
        </p>
        <p>
        	A Bibliography is a "identification, or description of writings or publications" (Merriam-Webster).  They usually appear at the end of documents to give more information on where the information cited came from.
        </p>
        <h2>Consequences of Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>
        	Plagiarism is a very serious academic infraction.  Plagiarizing can easily lead to being expelled and blacklisted from other schools, especially when it is caught at the college level.  You may never again be able to receive an education.
        </p>
        <p>
        	In more extreme cases of intellectual property theft, legal action can also occur.  This may result in criminal charges if it is classified as copyright infringement, and that can lead to a prison sentence, so <b>don't do it.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Complicity and Accomplice Liability</h2>
        <p>
        	A large part of plagiarism is not when a person personally plagiarizes, but when others aid or simply allow it to happen.  This is known as being complicit in the action.
        </p>
        <p>
        	This does not just include writing essays for money, and, depending on the institution's code of ethics, includes everything from not reporting it to encouraging others to plagiarize.  Depending on the institution, those who are guilty of plagiarism by accomplice may face equal punishment.
