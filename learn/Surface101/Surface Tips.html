<h3>What's the fuss about Windows when most people use Macintosh?</h3>

<p>Although the mainstream Operating System (OS) currently is the Mac OS, the old-school Windows OS has been going through a reformation, expanding and redirecting its focus to a newly emerged office/school information system: OneDrive. </p>
    
<p>The success of OneDrive has pursuaded the superiors of Dulwich College Beijing to implement this efficient, collaborate system circa 2015. This included the increase use of OneNote, SharePoint and other services provided by Microsoft. Thus, to compliment this change, the school has been heavily promoting the use of Microsoft's newest, and best, laptop series, the Surface. </p>

<p>Though not as popular among older students, the Surface computers have become a necessity for younger students.</p>

<h3>Integrating OneDrive with a Surface</h3>
    
    <h4>Storage</h4>
<p>Every email account comes with a free 5GB of storage on the Microsoft OneDrive, a platform that can be used to sync your files to an online cloud. Though this feature is also available to Macintosh users, but a quirky little feature makes owning a Surface computer so much more amazing.</p>

<p>Surface users can directly drag and drop their files into their OneDrive folder, located in the quick access bar in their file explorer. Then, they can log into their OneDrive accounts online <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=00000006-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&response_mode=form_post&response_type=code+id_token&scope=openid+profile&state=OpenIdConnect.AuthenticationProperties%3dnJvi_oI9H3GpAlrAEMUOSlXz6EDI6lGm_6zdC9EDDUPPIcF85-RiudMr91m8ESZY_H9KCva3tAbDD9SCppqia78SlqQ1nrmxAX5Qax1fE2q9em5EPrnRdgopTCUhzeUng-D5dXUaUQOPbKyMFjkBzhdehHHgM_0MkMGqc-pr0ZxlLFFmK1bZtPk-Ky2IbiAP&nonce=636417366881259103.MjhjNmZiOTctMjM0Ny00YzA4LTk0MmUtOGM1NDQ4NDE3ZDFkNWMyZTQxNjUtNmVmMC00MzMyLTllNTEtZTY1ZjhhOWMwMmRi&redirect_uri=https%3a%2f%2fportal.office.com%2flanding&ui_locales=en-US&mkt=en-US&client-request-id=822d22a7-56c2-4c61-adf6-4649540612d6&msafed=0">(here)</a> and their files would magically appear. Available for download and editing online. This essentially creates a free platform for users to backup their data, and not having to store it on their laptops.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>Another very enjoyable feature when using a Surface computer is the ability to easily collaborate (in real time!) with other people. If you are an experienced coder (probably not or else you shouldn't be reading this), it is similar to what GitHub offers. </p> 

    <p>To share a file, simply to go 'File' -> 'Share', and type in the email address of the desired receipiant. Then, they are able to access it online. To get a local copy of the file, select 'Edit Workbook' -> 'Edit in Excel', like shown in the screenshot below</p>
    
    <!-- insert edit_workbook_screenshot-->
    
<p>Once you've obtained a local copy, simply start editing and making changes. Once you've made these changes, click the save button on the top left corner, which will now feature a new sync icon. This is essentially uploading the changes you have made to the server, and anyone else that is editing the file will be able to see it when they click the sync button too.</p>

    <!-- insert savesync_button screenshot-->
    <p>One thing to note, however, is that <strong>conflicting changes</strong> can occur when two or more parties edit and sync the file and the same time. Essentially, this means that the system cannot decide who's copy to keep, so an error occurs.</p>

<h3>Useful Tips for a new Surface User</h3>
    
<ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Bring a charger around.</strong> We will get in depth with this in the next section. Due to the limited battery life (less so if you are a SurfaceBook owner), productivity easily comes to a halt when your device runs out of battery.</li>  <br>
    <li><strong>Don't download too much applications, the Surface is made for productivity.</strong> Sure, the Surface really enhances your working experience, but this will all be gone if you have too much unnecessary stuff on your device. As it operates with a touch screen, the available memory is less than it states.  </li>
    <li><strong>Use OneNote as often as possible!</strong> One of Dulwich's main goals is to reduce our carbon footprint; using OneNote to grind your way through past papers is so much better than printing out 40 A4 sheets! The Surface Pen also works the best (best sensitivity, most pen and color options) within the OneNote app. <sub>More on this on the OneNote page to come in the future.</sub></li>
    <li><strong>Take advantage of tablet mode.</strong> Being able to detach so easily and transforming your laptop into a tablet in a blink is something truly special. You can bring it to the loo, play music while showering, do homework, binge watch Game of Thrones... you name it. The versitality of the Surface series is unparallel.</li>
